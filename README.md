ML- Object Recignition-
->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
loading data,
 unique labels,
 20 superclasses,
 hot encoding, 
normalize the pixels, 
blocks of cnn,
 feature detector part of the model,
 pre-fit cnn model, applying dense layer,
 compiling and then fitting the model,
 use of history then seeing the accuracy,
 confusion matrix,
 prediction (coarse superclass),
 builidng the model on fine classes,
 again checking the accuracy confusion matricx of fine class,

->  method 2- with regularization using dropout and additional dense layer
compiling the model with dropout layer
-> fittting the dropout model 
-> plotting the history and accuracy
 droput confusion matrix
 -> dropout class analysis
-> prediction
-> >
-
So we applied all the three methods for applying the object recogintion
-

-> Method 3, SVM'
svm model
calling the svm function
